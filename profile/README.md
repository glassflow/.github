# GlassFlow Overview

**GlassFlow** is a tool to build Event-Driven data pipelines in Python. Users do not need Kafka or Flink and can run end to end data pipelines fully in Python. GlassFlow runs completly serverless without need to configure any clusters or handle complicated infrastructure. Start with our in-built message broker, Google Pub/Sub, Kinesis or our webhook to build your pipeline within 15 minutes.
